"""Fact-extraction diagnostics (C13.b).

Pre-C13.b: fact extraction had five silent-failure layers (cloud HTTP
errors, JSON parse failures, local LLM exceptions, no-LLM-available
fallback, outer try/except wrappers). Operators got zero signal that
extraction was running blind — fact-recall and the graph voice
silently degraded with no log line, no counter, no audit trail.

This module exposes a process-global counter set that records each
extraction attempt's outcome at every tier (host / remote / local /
cloud). Operators can query via `get_extraction_stats()` to see:
  - How many attempts have run since process start
  - How many succeeded at each tier
  - How many failed at each tier and why (recent error samples)
  - The current success rate

Thread-safe (a single threading.Lock gates all mutations). Process-
global because extraction calls fan out from many sites
(`extract_facts_safe`, `ExtractionClient`, the batch benchmark adapter)
and operators want one aggregate view, not per-instance fragmentation.

The diagnostics are read-only signal; they never affect extraction
behavior. Failures are still swallowed by the caller's `except`
blocks — diagnostics just surface the silence.
