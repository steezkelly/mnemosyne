"""Recall path provenance diagnostics (C4).

Pre-C4: `BeamMemory.recall` had three silent fallback layers per
tier (working and episodic):

  1. `_fts_search_working` / `_fts_search` — wrapped in `try/except`
     for WM. Returns empty list on exception, indistinguishable from
     legitimate "no match."
  2. `_wm_vec_search` / `_vec_search` / `_in_memory_vec_search` —
     wrapped in `try/except: pass` for WM. Same shape.
  3. When both FTS and vec return nothing, the code falls through to
     "fetch recent items by timestamp DESC, score by substring."

Operators (and the BEAM experiment) saw recall results without any
provenance. Could be from FTS-ranked hits (good signal), vector
similarity hits (good signal), or pure substring scoring on recent
items (weak signal). When the experiment compares arm A vs arm B
recall quality, hits from the fallback layer add noise to the
comparison.

This module exposes a process-global counter set that records per-
recall-call signals: how many FTS hits, how many vec hits, whether
the fallback fired. Operators query via `get_recall_diagnostics()`
to see the fallback-usage rate over a measurement window.

Diagnostics are read-only signal — they never alter recall behavior.
The fallback still fires when needed (legitimate no-match case);
diagnostics expose WHEN and HOW OFTEN.
