"""
Mnemosyne E6 Migration — TripleStore Split
==========================================

Idempotent migration that moves annotation-flavored rows out of the
legacy `triples` table and into the new `annotations` table. Fixes the
silent-destruction bug where adding multiple mentions / facts for one
memory silently invalidated prior rows via `(subject, predicate)`
auto-invalidation.

This module ships INSIDE the package so pip-installed deployments can
auto-migrate on first BeamMemory init. The CLI wrapper at
`scripts/migrate_triplestore_split.py` imports from here.

Behavior
--------
1. Detect rows in `triples` whose predicate is in ANNOTATION_KINDS
   (mentions, fact, occurred_on, has_source).
2. Insert each row into `annotations` using the (memory_id, kind, value)
   mapping (subject → memory_id, predicate → kind, object → value).
3. Skip rows that already have a corresponding row in `annotations`
   (idempotent — safe to re-run).
4. Do NOT delete the source rows from `triples`. They remain as legacy
   data; `annotations` is the canonical store post-migration. This
   makes the migration reversible — restore the DB from backup if needed.
