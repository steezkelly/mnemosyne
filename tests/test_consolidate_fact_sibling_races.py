"""
Regression tests for race-pattern fix on `VeracityConsolidator`
sibling methods: `resolve_conflict`, `resolve_conflict_by_facts`,
`run_consolidation_pass`.

E2.a.5 (PR #84) closed the SELECT-then-write race in
`consolidate_fact`. The /review army on that PR flagged that the
three sibling write methods on the same class have the same
shape and are unprotected. E2.a.6 fixes them by extracting a
shared `_serialized_write` context manager and applying it to all
three.

Severity profile (analyzed during fix implementation):
  - `resolve_conflict`: **real bug.** Two concurrent calls with
    different `winning_fact_id` values on the same conflict_id can
    leave BOTH facts superseded.
  - `resolve_conflict_by_facts`: single UPDATE, no SELECT-write
    race shape. Wrapped for consistency.
  - `run_consolidation_pass`: read-decide-resolve loop. Race is
    benign (idempotent decisions) but wrapped to prevent
    interleaved writes from other writers during the pass.

These tests pin:
  - Concurrent `resolve_conflict` with conflicting winners produces
    a deterministic single winner, not both-superseded.
  - `_serialized_write` participates in caller-owned outer
    transactions.
  - `run_consolidation_pass` calling `resolve_conflict_by_facts`
    nests correctly (inner doesn't try its own BEGIN IMMEDIATE).
  - All three methods preserve their pre-fix happy-path behavior.
