"""
Regression tests for `consolidate_fact` concurrent same-SPO race.

Pre-fix: `consolidate_fact` did SELECT-by-SPO then conditional
INSERT or UPDATE without transaction serialization. Two threads
both passing the no-match SELECT and both attempting INSERT raced
on the deterministic PRIMARY KEY — one INSERT succeeded, the
other raised `IntegrityError` which propagated up to (or was
swallowed by) the caller's broad `except: pass`. Result: silent
data loss — the second thread's observation was never recorded.

Bayesian confidence updates were also race-vulnerable. The formula
`new = old + (1 - old) * weight * 0.3` is path-dependent: two
concurrent UPDATEs that both read the same baseline confidence
both compute the same new value, then both write — the second
UPDATE overwrites the first's effect rather than compounding it.

Post-fix: `consolidate_fact` wraps the SELECT-then-INSERT/UPDATE
in `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` so concurrent calls serialize at SQLite's
writer-lock level. Nested-transaction safe (skips BEGIN if the
caller already opened one, e.g., E2's `_deferred_commits`).

These tests pin:
  - N threads consolidating the same SPO produce exactly one row
    with `mention_count == N`.
  - N threads consolidating distinct SPOs produce N rows.
  - The nested-transaction path (caller in `BEGIN`) doesn't crash
    and produces the same end state.
  - No IntegrityError surfaces under contention.
