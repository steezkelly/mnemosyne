"""Regression tests for E3.a.3 — cross-tier recall dedup.

Pre-E3, `BeamMemory.sleep()` DELETEd source `working_memory` rows after
creating an `episodic_memory` summary, so a single logical fact lived in
exactly one place at recall time. Post-E3 (additive sleep) the sources
survive alongside the summary by design — a recall whose query matches
both ranks them next to each other and compounds `recall_count` twice
per call for the same fact.

This file pins the post-fix contract: when an episodic row's
`summary_of` references a working_memory row's id AND both appear in a
recall result set, the lower-scored side is dropped before top-K
truncation and recall_count attribution.

Why this matters for the BEAM-recovery experiment: Arm A (linear) and
Arm B (polyphonic) both run on the same data shape but historically had
different duplicate-handling. Linear ranked duplicates side-by-side;
polyphonic relied on its diversity rerank to "naturally" collapse them.
Applying identical summary_of-based dedup to both arms removes one
confound from arm-vs-arm comparison: any score delta now reflects
RRF-vs-linear-scoring, not dedup-behavior asymmetry.
