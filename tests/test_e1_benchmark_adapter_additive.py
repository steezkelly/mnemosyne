"""Regression tests for E1 — additive BEAM benchmark adapter.

Pre-E1: `tools/evaluate_beam_end_to_end.py::ingest_conversation` ran a
destructive batch-summary pattern. Per BATCH_SIZE=500 messages it:
  1. SELECTed all working_memory rows for the session
  2. Built a synthetic summary: "Batch N: first_3_msg_contents[:100chars]"
     truncated to 500 chars
  3. Called consolidate_to_episodic with that paltry summary
  4. DELETEd all source working_memory rows

Net effect: ~99% of message content was discarded before recall could
see it. At 500K messages (~250K conversation turns) the BEAM benchmark
ran on ~500 episodic rows of mostly-empty template strings instead of
the actual corpus. Every experiment arm produced a noise-dominated
signal.

Post-E1 (option b — use the real pipeline now that E3 is additive):
  - `remember_batch` writes originals (unchanged)
  - Timestamps are backdated past sleep's cutoff (benchmark-internal
    detail, real users don't need this)
  - `beam.sleep()` produces real LLM-generated (or AAAK-fallback)
    summaries on top of preserved originals
  - working_memory row count is preserved
  - episodic_memory grows with substantive summaries

These tests pin the new contract.
