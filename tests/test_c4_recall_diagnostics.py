"""Regression tests for C4 — recall path provenance diagnostics.

Pre-C4: `BeamMemory.recall` had silent fallback layers per tier.

  - WM: `_fts_search_working` wrapped in `try/except: wm_fts = []`;
    `_wm_vec_search` in `try/except: pass`. When both produced
    nothing (legitimate no-match OR error), the code fell through to
    "fetch recent items, score by substring on content." Operators
    saw results but had no signal whether they came from FTS/vec
    ranking or pure substring matching on recent items.

  - EM: same shape — vec/FTS each returned, and if both empty, the
    fallback at "if not episodic_rowids" fired with substring
    scoring on the most-recent 500 episodic rows.

For the BEAM experiment specifically, this matters: arm-vs-arm
recall quality comparisons would mix "FTS-ranked good signal" with
"substring-on-recent weak signal" without operators knowing the
ratio. C4's fix is to expose provenance — the fallback still fires
when needed, but its usage rate is now measurable.

These tests pin:
  - The `RecallDiagnostics` class API
  - Process-global singleton lifecycle
  - The instrumentation in `BeamMemory.recall()` — each fallback
    path increments the right counter
  - The recall behavior itself is unchanged (no regression)
